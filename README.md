# Amerigo
An example of RESTful SSH tunneling.

## Imagine if this thing was real ...

Amerigo could receive commands via HTTP and then issue deploys, patches — really anything — to manage a product.

This is cool because it really simplifies deployment for an engineering team.

But it gets cooler when thinking about non-engineers. Imagine QA or Product people having a web interface that could hit Amerigo and manage deploys, toggle branches, etc. That’d be awesome for workflow!

Taking it to the radical next level: if Amerigo had some SMTP love baked in, we could deploy via email from our phones. Whoa!
